 To implement, and experiment the Fiduccia-Mattheyses partitioning algorithm implemented for gate-level
 designs. The goal of the partitioning project is to minimize the cut set size, while meeting given area
 constraints fixed for the partitions
 
 (1).C++ is used for implementation.(2)Pearl script is used to read and modify the benchmark files to extract the required data
